2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,385
I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

3
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,513
Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

4
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,557
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,724
'Course not.

6
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:17,728
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:24,576
_
Murphy, join t' party, huh?

8
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,522
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,815
I'm married.

10
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,235
Right.
What's wrong?

11
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:28,572
_
Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife
All you guys having a good time?

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,904
You gotta let it go, man.
There's good that came out of this.

13
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:29,240
are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

14
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:30,824
No, no, Carrillo's solid.
Yeah, we used him,
then we got him killed.

15
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:32,096
_
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

16
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,204
Did you drop your wallet?
No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

17
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:36,372
Passport.
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

18
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,723
Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.
How important is this cat to you?

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,457
Look on the bright side, huh?

20
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,000
Excuse me?

21
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,143
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,
You gave someone your passport?

22
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,380
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

23
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,605
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.
We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

24
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,383
"Puff"?
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

25
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.
I didn't name it, dude.

26
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,012
Traffickers pay people
at the airports for intel.
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

27
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:56,656
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

28
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

29
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,950
First off,
there was no Internet.
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

30
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,688
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

31
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,451
No cells.

32
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,203
The best they had were satellite phones,
Fucking price on my head?
Finally, the Colombian government
had to react.

33
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:06,541
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

34
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

35
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:10,920
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...
but you're safe... because of Kiki.
WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

36
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:13,657
Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

37
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,381
the landowners, the politicians...
The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

38
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,955
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

39
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:18,469
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

40
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,333
Kiki was captured and tortured.
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US,

41
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,419
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

42
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,225
What's up, Lizard?
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.MY-SUBS.com
used an electric drill on his head
until he died.
This made all the difference in the world.

43
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,603
We're going out tonight.
If you were a narco in Colombia,

44
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:29,049
What the fuck were they thinking?

45
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,471
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?
jail time meant banging girls,
watching movies,

46
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,944
And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.
By the time I left Miami,
hanging with the fellas...

47
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,182
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.
Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

48
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

49
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,158
the voices of our targets.
To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.
They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world
It was a fucking joke.

50
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,144
Back home,
it was a whole different deal.

51
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.
got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

52
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day,
just like every other loser,

53
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,569
He died to save us all.

54
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?
Do not tell Connie that story.

55
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,463
Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.
a fucking nightmare.

56
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,451
Oh... Yeah.
I won't.
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?
Now Pablo had someone to fear: us.

57
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

58
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,411
That's beautiful.
This cat is DEA.

59
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,830
They were flying so many planes,
Mark my words, it will get justice.

60
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,057
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

61
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,308
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

62
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,938
Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

63
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,090
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

64
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,189
La Dispensaria.

65
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,928
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

66
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,859
I've got a table ready.

67
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,487
Show up around midnight.
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

68
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- Poison didn't know it,

69
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,910
but he'd just made himself a date.
- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

70
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

71
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,066
Let's get down!

72
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,874
Hammer, disengage.

73
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

74
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.
The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

75
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

76
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,470
By "the other guy," he meant me.

77
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,723
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.
We should be over the Amazon by now.

78
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:50,352
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

79
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:52,424
From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

80
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,479
Hello?

81
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,023
Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

82
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,941
Got it.
But things were different
on the ground.

83
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

84
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,070
OK.
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

85
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,739
I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

86
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

87
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:10,066
From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

88
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:09,246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

89
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,498
Hola.

90
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,251
La Dispensaria?
At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

91
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,377
All right.
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

92
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,381
Guess who that was.

93
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,717
Your partner.
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,512
He just gave me a great gift.

95
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,973
Poison.
They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

96
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,669
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

- With our help, you will.
- Oh, that's right.

98
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

99
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:34,466
¿Patrón?
Gringos to the rescue.

100
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,315
Yeah, sure.
Looks good?
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

101
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,526
He's not a fool.
Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

102
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,472
This is going
to sell better than the original.

103
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,820
Gotta go.
It was the product.
One man with helicopters, airplanes,
vehicles, planned escape routes,

104
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,907
Gonna stick me with the bill?
It's time to take Pablo's money.

105
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,101
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money,

106
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:48,897
The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.
My name is everywhere.
- men, weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

107
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,455
Cheap son of a bitch.
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

108
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,167
In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.
Newspapers...

109
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,070
Search.

110
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,128
Javier Peña, my partner.
What's happening? Look at that.
magazines...
Help us catch him.

111
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,715
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

112
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,991
Let me take care of that.

113
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.
Your prize dog didn't even stop.
Everyone is talking about
the "Paisa Robin Hood."

114
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,637
Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.
There's no coke in that boat.
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

115
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,289
Come here.
Pablito, I'm sorry.
If I had known that--

116
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,959
You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

117
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:12,295
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

118
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,436
Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.
Anything you want, Pablito.

119
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,925
Give me the money...
the cash!
Anything I want?
Escobar will not go lightly.

120
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,355
Especially the local hitmen.
Yes, my love,
whatever you want.

121
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,191
Colombians call them sicarios.
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.
You sure?

122
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:21,027
- What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.
Uh-huh.
He will make Colombia bleed.

123
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,433
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

124
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,530
Let's go inside and have a good time.

125
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,642
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

126
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,615
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.
It's OK, it's OK.

127
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

128
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,163
Probably hundreds.
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?
- Shut up, fag.
- What the fuck, Carlos?

129
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
But don't get me wrong.

130
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.
It's my dog.

131
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,902
Why are you always defending him?

132
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,571
Then...
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

133
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

134
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,993
you're going to help me
get into Congress.

135
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,910
Son of a bitch.

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,454
What happened?

137
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,956
You want to know what happened? Go look.
Yes, Pablo.

138
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,430
It's on, boys!
Gentlemen...

139
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.
Pablo?
Yes.

140
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:55,380
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.
I suggest we form another organization

141
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,895
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

142
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,423
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

143
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,189
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

144
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,775
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all dead. Come on.
Like John Lennon said,

145
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,652
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?
- "Come together, brothers and sisters..."
- Stop that fag shit right now.

146
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,154
Yes, sir!
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.
Those shitty oligarchs.

147
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,474
So Jorge...

148
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,020
Those people,
all of their lives...
what will we call it?

149
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,020
Let's see...
First, "Death to Kidnappers,"
then "the Extraditables."

150
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:15,025
don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

151
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,484
This is the problem?
Once again, the narcos were united
against a common enemy: jail in America.

152
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,735
People are watching us, Pablo.

153
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:20,253
I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

154
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:20,489
I come from nothing, Valeria...
But it was not quite like
"one for all, and all for one."

155
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:24,033
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

156
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,702
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

157
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,676
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.
just launder the money.
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.
It was more like each man for himself.

158
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,329
Next!

159
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:33,710
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.
Gacha, being Gacha, decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

160
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:34,086
"I made my money from taxis" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

161
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,671
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

162
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,838
Isn't that what Al Capone did?
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

163
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,007
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

164
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.
You need a proper political campaign.
Next!

165
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,886
Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

166
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,513
You're a dumbass, Pablo.
I buy the press, my love.

167
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,015
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

168
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,726
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.
And as far as a political party,

169
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:51,478
I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

170
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,811
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

171
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,395
This is too much to launder.

172
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,731
Well, then...
I don't want to be good.
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

173
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,941
I mean, all of our problems...

174
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,527
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

175
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,361
I am going to be great.
are because of those imperialist gringos!

176
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,154
And that's what they tried first.
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD
A drug dealer running
for president. It was crazy, right?

177
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:07,202
On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.
No, stay there... stay there.

178
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,202
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.
As for the Ochoa brothers,
they went with a fancy PR firm

179
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,453
He only had three cars,
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

180
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,873
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.
and got ripped off because, well...
that's what PR agencies do.

181
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,750
He was a fucking winner.

182
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,419
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.
The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.
"Better a grave in Colombia

183
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,672
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.
than a grave in the United States."

184
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,256
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,
No, I've got it, Fabio, I've got it.
Let's see...

185
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,009
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

186
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,345
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

187
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,179
and all he had to do was to get to them.
- What do you think?
- I love it.

188
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,348
Everybody was happy.
Very good.

189
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,559
And in order to do that,
And for $50,000 more,
we'll make your logo.

190
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,771
But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

191
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,603
Done.

192
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,815
It just kept coming in.

193
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,693
By the way,
here's the logo $50,000 got you.

194
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:41,194
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

195
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,656
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,
In the upcoming presidential election,
extradition became the defining issue

196
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:45,657
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

197
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:46,450
a party who claimed
to represent the people.
amongst the candidates.

198
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,536
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...
Those the narcos could buy,
they bought.

199
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,827
The ones they could scare,
they scared.

200
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,373
I told you we have to fly low.
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

201
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,332
Pablo!

202
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,586
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.
I should've gotten into the taxi business.
And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

203
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,878
- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

204
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,004
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.
Mr. Duque.
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

205
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,257
Enough, Gustavo, enough.
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

206
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

207
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,426
What do you want me to say?
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

208
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:10,748
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.MY-SUBS.com
Bury it.
After you, Valeria.
"And to conclude, I want
to express my most energetic protest

209
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,889
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

210
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,058
And cut the bullshit.
Please.
over the improper interference
of North America

211
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

212
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,367
My fellow Americans...
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

213
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,785
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.
Go on, pussy.
of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

214
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,956
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

215
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,609
And that's what they did.
And for that reason,
I think that...
He's got some balls.

216
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,860
They buried it in fields...
Well, I think that
I understand the people
Escobar is shameless.

217
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,959
We thought he was one of the good guys.
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán.

218
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy
they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

219
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,077
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States,

220
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,048
because he hated the commies.

221
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

222
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,289
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

223
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:38,210
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

224
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.
Hey, Mom.
My campaign manager,
Dr. Gaviria,

225
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,630
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

226
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,215
And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

227
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle,

228
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,689
Maybe not such a good guy after all.
- No, no--
- Look, I am not a politician.

229
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,593
Sit.
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.
when clearly,
they're losing a war.

230
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

231
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,434
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

232
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,241
But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.
If you speak in favor
of extradition, you will be their puppet,

233
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,854
- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

234
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:57,646
I'll buy you another sofa later.
and that will be your death sentence.

235
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,705
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?
your piece would be what?
$300,000 just for you.
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

236
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.
No.
All bankers are bandits.
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

237
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,822
Really, honey?
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?
then let them take them.

238
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,672
How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?
Since he couldn't get to Galán,

239
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,784
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

240
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,302
They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"
Let's go look at the hippos.
Come on.

241
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

242
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,954
not because he looked like a pirate,

243
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,511
to ship the product north.
Blackie.
if no judge was willing to apply it.

244
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:19,265
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

245
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,834
Pablo?

246
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

247
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,351
You're surrounded!
But not even the pirate did the trick.
- And what about me?
- What about you?

248
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,853
- Hands up!
- Everybody on your knees!
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States,

249
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,674
The problem was Colombia itself.

250
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,481
But Pinochet spoiled the party.
I don't get my piece?
know we, the Extraditables,
will pass judgment on you

251
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,441
What the fuck is going on here?
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.
No, my queen.
The thing is that you...

252
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,525
On the ground!
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.
and bring a sentence far harsher."

253
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:33,862
He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.
you're in this for love, right?

254
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

255
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

256
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,977
Forbes Magazine says...
Look, Minister...
For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

257
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,994
And then, being Pinochet...
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

258
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,189
that the narcos have more money
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

259
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,080
he had them all killed.
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.
Defendants, please rise.

260
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,791
Attention!
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

261
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:47,863
Let me see?

262
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:48,419
Weapons ready!
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

263
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:49,920
Aim!
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

264
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,922
Ready ammunition!
Call the police?

265
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:56,663
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

266
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,883
Fire!
Commander.
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

267
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:57,748
Take a look.
Despite his threats,
many brave men defied him.

268
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,751
I say we kidnap his son.
These are property holdings papers.

269
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,547
He's a psycho maniac, comrade.
And true to form,
when the pen failed...

270
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,896
They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

271
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

272
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,718
Plus, he's bought off half the military.
Look.

273
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,900
only the cockroaches will survive.
He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

274
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,471
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

275
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,694
I guess they were right.

276
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,891
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.
In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

277
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:18,602
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

278
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,
How about her?
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

279
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,732
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.
Well, guess again.

280
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,287
and he was smart enough to play dead.
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

281
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,984
How much is he paying you?

282
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,275
Wait a second.
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

283
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,501
He wasn't killed on that day.
What about Pablo Escobar?
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

284
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,280
I know what you're thinking.
Escobar is prepared
to contribute millions of dollars.
We got FARC, we got M-19,
we got EPL, we got ELN,

285
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,922
Instead, he won the damn lottery.
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

286
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,080
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

287
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,872
But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.
Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems,

288
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

289
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,709
M-19 was a communist guerrilla group
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

290
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.
What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

291
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,086
made up of college students
and intellectuals
Communists. Remember them?

292
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.
or fewer representatives in Congress?

293
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,591
With Reagan in the White House,
it was hard to forget.

294
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,482
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.
And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

295
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,552
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

296
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,443
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.
In his words:
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

297
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,346
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,
You're not going back to that comuna!

298
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,990
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.
but understood the power of symbols.
What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

299
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,894
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum
Oh, my God, you do.

300
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,410
A drug trafficker.
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,
Honey, your cat was killed
as a warning to me.
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

301
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:05,746
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.
Our cat.

302
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,606
OK, our cat.
In Washington,
he created the Reagan Doctrine,

303
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:09,444
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,
What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

304
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

305
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:12,253
Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

306
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

307
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,172
on the human brain.
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world,

308
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,509
We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.
you'd better be chasing reds.

309
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,663
- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets,

310
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,928
...this will give us better results, OK?

311
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.
the Colombians will get Escobar.

312
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

313
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

314
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,712
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

315
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:33,441
It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

316
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:33,884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

317
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,925
These jokers even left a note:
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

318
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,220
I already stick out like a sore thumb.

319
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...
"Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."
The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

320
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,265
Just humor me.
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

321
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,906
unless we're talking about cocaine.
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

322
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,479
And it made them famous overnight.
Mm...
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

323
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.
And I guess it went to their heads.
Let the Colombians get him.

324
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,652
Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

325
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.
What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.
I'll scream if I need you.
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

326
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,169
Gracias.
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

327
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,574
Escobar gives money to the poor.

328
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

329
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

330
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,370
He's all right with me.

331
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,080
OK, then.
- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.
So what do we do now?

332
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,348
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.
Let's do the Ochoas.
What, are you surprised to see me?
We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

333
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,685
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.
Well, this one will keep coming.
It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

334
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,256
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

335
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.
Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

336
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

337
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,363
A typical Colombian smuggling family.
working in the comuna?
That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.
But the head of counternarcotics,
General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

338
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,865
- They were smart and rich...
- Salud!
And the priest... innocent, right?

339
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

340
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,023
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

341
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,
Who is the gringa?
Thank you for seeing me, General.

342
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:35,571
March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,
A child of God, just like you.
You're welcome.

343
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,836
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.
Hm. Got it.
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

344
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.
With all due respect, General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

345
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,538
Let's see, you are here for a cat?
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

346
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,956
Hola.
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.
Well, I don't want him to follow.

347
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.
Good afternoon.

348
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,836
- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.
I want him to lead.

349
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,767
If you make it to the top...
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- Sí.
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

350
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,230
it means you've killed your enemies.

351
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,591
Does the cat have any papers?
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.
Go ahead.

352
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,802
- Sí.
- Please.

353
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,360
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?
Yes, General.

354
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,195
And sometimes, your partners.
Your friend is a little crazy.
As you wish.

355
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,473
Thank you.
No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.
Understood.

356
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:04,935
I don't speak English.

357
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.
Mm.
Get me some information, Suárez.
What happened, honey?

358
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,396
Things with work.

359
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,317
Look, I don't have enough people
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

360
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.
Excuse me a second, please.
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

361
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,199
If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

362
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,993
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.
Tell me what's wrong.

363
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,761
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.
- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

364
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,957
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form
Tell me about it.

365
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,180
The man who would
change my life forever.
But if you want
to put all my people to work

366
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,792
and no I-435
identifying papers, either.
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

367
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:33,394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

368
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:34,881
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

369
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,937
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

370
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:41,637
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

371
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,817
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

372
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,429
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

373
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,053
Hm.

374
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.
Find out.
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

375
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:47,643
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

376
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,701
They didn't play by the same rules.
- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

377
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,148
Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

378
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,579
Good day.
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

379
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,776
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

380
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,622
Pablo Escobar?

381
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,123
Where's Felipo?
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

382
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,251
Felipo's been arrested.
OK, sir.
This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

383
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.
And most of all, to the top brass.

384
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?
My boss is not having a good day.
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

385
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.
I think his wife left him.
Mm.

386
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.
That's not true.
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

387
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,596
Show some respect.
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?
These guys killed his cat.

388
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,416
Egrets from the Himalayas.

389
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,016
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

390
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,544
Excuse me?
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

391
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,337
OK.
is a federal crime.

392
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,104
How do you know my name?
Come with me, please.
Is this funny to you?
They cost me a million dollars.

393
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

394
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

395
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,431
Bastards.

396
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:31,118
There's Garcia, Lopez...
Yes, I need it.
Stay in the fucking tree!

397
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,245
- Is that Pinilla?
- Yes, Pinilla.

398
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

399
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,039
Pinilla...

400
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

401
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.
So... wait here, please.
Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

402
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,754
I don't have all day.
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

403
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,742
Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

404
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,494
How long is it gonna be?
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?
That's your problem, Pablo.

405
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,551
Open it.
I don't know.

406
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,581
- What?
- May I?
You think that everything
can be controlled,

407
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,082
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

408
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,250
Pablo! Pablo!
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK.

409
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,419
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,
of the United States.

410
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,047
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

411
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,604
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

412
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:02,177
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

413
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,398
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Your English is really good.

414
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:04,901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

415
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,779
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.
How long you been at the comuna?

416
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,572
Oh, yeah? You don't say.
This is absurd.
Just a few weeks.

417
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,449
Where are your import papers?
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--
Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

418
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,786
You need papers for these TV sets.
I'm just not used
to these type of things.
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

419
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,287
Take them.
Just be yourself.
You will not disrespect them!

420
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,360
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

421
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:22,085
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.
Is that clear?

422
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:25,158
If I open my mouth, they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

423
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,531
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

424
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,505
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

425
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,381
It's for Carlitos.
It might not be good for the baby.
He's having problems with his wife.

426
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,425
Your son.
Go to the house.
Shut up!
- I fucked up.
- How?

427
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

428
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?
- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

429
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,376
This is quite simple.

430
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,809
Hey, Pinilla!
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

431
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

432
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?
he'll fire him for incompetence,

433
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,092
and me and you,
we lose the only cop we can trust.

434
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:48,195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

435
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,681
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

436
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,140
How does that sound?
- Hey!
- Hey!

437
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,764
- Sorry I'm late, honey.
- Mm...

438
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,492
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.
What's that?
Couples counseling.

439
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,309
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

440
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,995
- Right? She's a fox.
- Yeah.
Right.
I sent a copy of that passport...
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

441
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,689
What're you doing?
Nice to meet you.

442
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,873
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.
to a man they call...
Are you another... janitor at the embassy,
like Steve?

443
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,834
What's she doing with a guy like you?
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"

444
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:02,279
"Poison."
No, actually, I'm CIA.

445
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,489
But that's classified,
so don't tell anybody.

446
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,408
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.
OK, Poison.

447
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,496
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

448
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,676
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?
Yeah, you heard that right.

449
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:13,455
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.
And this is the address.
- The janitor thing, what, that was you?
- Mm.

450
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?
And in a way, she was right.
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,
No, it's just a cover.

451
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,336
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

452
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,169
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

453
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,671
that's when you give it to the poor.
No violence.
Just so you know,
I'm a communist guerrillera.

454
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,479
Colonel, how is your mom doing?
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.
And you call me every two hours.

455
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,758
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

456
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,733
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.
Tell us about your program,
"Medellín Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.
Perfect.

457
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,261
No showing off!
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

458
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,985
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- Yes.
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

459
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

460
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:31,530
Gentlemen...
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people
What the fuck are you doing?
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

461
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,783
I'm going to tell you who I am.
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

462
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,313
can be so out of touch
with what they need.
He had better resources
and better information.

463
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:39,162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Getting ready, right?

464
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,066
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.
And at the time,
he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

465
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,541
My eyes are everywhere.
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

466
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

467
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them, too.

468
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,755
without me knowing about it.
Politicians scare easily.

469
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,925
Do you understand? Not a finger.
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?
But not all of them.

470
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,788
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.
You're fine with just a pistol.
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

471
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,455
Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumbass.

472
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,765
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

473
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,625
According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

474
00:15:55,873 --> 00:16:02,088
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

475
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,170
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

476
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,895
So look, I make deals for a living.
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

477
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,838
For what purpose,
we don't know.

478
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,799
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

479
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:06,523
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

480
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,304
They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...
we're sending the wrong message.
Trapped a little bird.

481
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,860
or accept the consequences.
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

482
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,764
Connie, you know who that is?
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.
Jesus.

483
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,350
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.
The narcos have informants
in their department.

484
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,865
Silver...
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

485
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,061
I can't believe it.

486
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,076
or lead.
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority
Just remember that you wanted all in.

487
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,315
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

488
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,121
You decide.
- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
Hand me that coffee.

489
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,526
but you know where we are.

490
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,361
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

491
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- All right, then.
At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

492
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,535
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

493
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,492
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

494
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,036
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

495
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,456
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.
He already gave up
the name of three fincas,

496
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

497
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,126
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

498
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,502
Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.
But you do know
where he is hiding, don't you?

499
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,798
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination--
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

500
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,714
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

501
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,383
Your passport.
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to--

502
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,594
Poison's killed three of my men already.

503
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,344
I'm sorry?
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

504
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,221
Your passport, please.

505
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,931
Then you guys gotta go.

506
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,688
Gracias.

507
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,442
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

508
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,984
Sixty-five.
Look, little brother,

509
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,195
Hey, brother, that's a lot.
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

510
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,905
You sure?

511
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,575
I counted every single son of a bitch.

512
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,994
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?
All right!
But I will also kill you.

513
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,383
Yo, Pablo!
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?
And very slowly.

514
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,330
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

515
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,845
- This is Pablo.
- Hello.
Of course,
that was number 65.

516
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,888
- Nice to meet you.
- Mateo Moreno.
Janitorial services.
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

517
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.
Another one.

518
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,129
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

519
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,476
All right,
yesterday we were talking,
Your embassy must be very clean.

520
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

521
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,675
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out,

522
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,482
Explain.
I shot him first.
but there was a small part of me
that thought, in his arrogance,

523
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.
Your cat's cleared.

524
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,737
I will handle
the chemical part of production,
he would stand and fight.

525
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.
Enjoy Colombia.
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

526
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,101
Come in.

527
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.
Boss!

528
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,521
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?
Poison...

529
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:44,287
Now tell him how much it costs.
So?
Boss!

530
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,692
And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

531
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,333
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

532
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,029
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

533
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

534
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,657
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,
Two hours, boss.
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

535
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:57,467
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

536
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,076
- We're leaving.
- All right.

537
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,053
Also...
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

538
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.
We have to go.

539
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,100
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?
Eh!
Go where?
The police are coming.

540
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,381
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

541
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,
As for Valeria Velez,

542
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,549
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

543
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,814
we can find room on our trucks.
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.
Look, 65, man!

544
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,358
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...
We'll buy new ones later,
won't we?

545
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,819
We're going to be rich.
She was as dangerous as M-19.
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

546
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

547
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,184
Son of a bitch.
I'm sorry.

548
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,311
Yes?
Do you hear me complaining?

549
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,117
Well look, Cuca...
Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

550
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,120
you don't have any vision,
my friend.
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

551
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:29,525
As long as you're with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

552
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,817
And how much is it going to cost me?

553
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...
Ten percent... $300,000.

554
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,820
Does your wife do it standing up?

555
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.
Aah!

556
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:40,121
Don't ever disrespect Tata.
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

557
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,968
I love that song.
That Poison... he talks too much.

558
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,537
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,723
Rodrigo! One more.
Do you hear me?
You should take his phone away.
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

560
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,209
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

561
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,460
Five percent.

562
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,671
I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

563
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,130
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

564
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,550
Forgive me.
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

565
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,305
OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

566
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,513
Yes, sir!

567
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,182
It won't happen again.

568
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,434
I promise.

569
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,582
Back then, Miami was a paradise.
- Hello?
- Poison?

570
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,111
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

571
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,543
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

572
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:15,739
How can I apologize? Huh?
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

573
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,465
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.
What's wrong, Gustavo?

574
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,160
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

575
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,716
DEA! Stop!

576
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,929
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.
You fucked us, Pablo.

577
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,498
Not only you and me.

578
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,333
Pablo is really pissed off.

579
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?
You fucked the whole family.

580
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,728
Why you running, huh?
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

581
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

582
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:35,816
What is that?

583
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.
You gotta give it to her.
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

584
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,196
Let's go celebrate.
She saw Pablo coming a mile away.
OK!
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

585
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

586
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,828
Go! Go! Go!

587
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,232
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.
But what the fuck...

588
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,371
How you like me now?
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

589
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,623
How much money you owe me?
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.
a man only dies once, right?

590
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

591
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,169
That's right, that's right.
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

592
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,824
Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,
Come here.

593
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,757
All right.
All right, who do we pick?
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

594
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,467
How 'bout her?

595
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,969
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

596
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,054
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"
My brother.

597
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,973
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?
but he is much more than that.
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

598
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,184
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

599
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,353
- Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.
There we go.

600
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,882
To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

601
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,729
- All right.
- Whoo!

602
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,940
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

603
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,861
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

604
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,680
a former congressman from Antioquia.

605
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,487
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

606
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

607
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,951
Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

608
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,978
We get better every time we practice.
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

609
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.
You're amazing, Javier.
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

610
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,332
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

611
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,942
Well...
I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

612
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

613
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,753
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.
don't go overboard.
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

614
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

615
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:44,592
You dicking me around?
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

616
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,079
From now on,
nowhere is safe.

617
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,914
It's the truth.
And this fight must begin here!

618
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,930
Fuck it, I'm going in.

619
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,182
- Go get her.
- Mm!
What can you offer me to drink?

620
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,059
- Yup.
- Hey, while you're up there,
Whiskey or tap water.

621
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,643
get us another pitcher, will ya?
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

622
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.
Water.

623
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,677
If I am elected...

624
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:03,181
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

625
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:07,310
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

626
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,727
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

627
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,366
How you doing?
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

628
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,202
Busy.
It's fine the way it is.
Those who are hungry will have food.

629
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:15,331
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.
Well, I wasn't offering.
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

630
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,944
Those who want to learn will have schools.

631
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know...
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

632
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,656
And those who have dreams

633
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:23,951
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

634
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,674
Yeah, those bastards got me.
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

635
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,619
Here.
In me, you have a friend

636
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,094
But I couldn't let it end like that.
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

637
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,013
Excuse me.
See those guys over there?
whom you have always had,
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

638
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,875
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

639
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,599
Uh, they're fucking with me.
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

640
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:36,144
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

641
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,478
You're a cop?
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

642
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,898
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.
Thank you very much.

643
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,149
Drug Enforcement?
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- Thank you very much.
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

644
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

645
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,613
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?
Blackbeard.

646
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,057
Take it.
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

647
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

648
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,076
give me your phone number?
And my visa?
My friend, Jairo Ortega!
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

649
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,494
How about a fake number?
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

650
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,580
That'll work.

651
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,125
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

652
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,657
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice,

653
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,365
What are you doing this weekend?

654
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,535
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?
Thank you very much.
home of Colombia's supreme court,

655
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

656
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,330
I have to take care of my child.

657
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,915
I can pay, too.
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

658
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,418
- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

659
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.
- Yes.
- Very good, Pablo.

660
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,002
Fuck.

661
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,894
Have a good night.
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

662
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,797
Fuck.

663
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,466
OK, whatever you say.
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

664
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,275
Aah...
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

665
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,759
Come here.
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

666
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,525
Shot down!
Congratulations, ma'am.
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

667
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

668
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,015
Excuse me.
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

669
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.
Give me a kiss.
None of it can leave the room.

670
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

671
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:36,537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

672
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,290
How much did that cost you?
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

673
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:40,500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

674
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:43,155
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

675
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,614
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

676
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:47,451
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

677
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,824
Take 'em.

678
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,592
I figured, what the hell.
Some of us are even going by plane.

679
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,747
Tata, what's wrong?
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

680
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:53,096
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

681
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,039
What are you talking about?

682
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,500
Helena?
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

683
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,001
Helena.
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

684
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,213
What are you talking about?

685
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,687
Hello?
Whose party is it?
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

686
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,648
So it wasn't a fake.
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

687
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,193
I thought you might figure it out.
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.
They're not gonna
search a white boy, OK?

688
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,695
After all, you're DEA.
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

689
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,157
And just like that... she had me.
Oh, God! What was that?
And right now, I'm the news.
Just do it.

690
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,184
That was like a .38.
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

691
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,228
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

692
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:18,621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

693
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,021
- And sometimes, bad people...
- Señor.

694
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,692
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.
...help you do good things.

695
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,498
cocaine had him.

696
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,278
Slowly... come on.
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

697
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,947
Come on.
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

698
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,919
It's been a while.

699
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,588
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

700
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,245
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.
Yes.

701
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,092
Would you like a little coffee?

702
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:33,872
Welcome to Bogotá.
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

703
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,802
Yeah, a coffee?
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

704
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,887
Yes, a coffee.

705
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,055
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.
Should we do it under the bed?
Obviously, it's an alias.

706
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,681
You sure?
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

707
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,894
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

708
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:39,712
She degrades you.

709
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,465
Please, don't worry about Valeria.
Because he's not Colombian.

710
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:45,857
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

711
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,763
Pablo!

712
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,610
Little magic leaves.
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

713
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,448
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.
A car, please!
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

714
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:59,495
Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.
A car to the hospital, now!
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

715
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,667
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.
Just one thing...
Who told you about this?
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

716
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,446
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

717
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,755
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.
You know what, Pablo?

718
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,949
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

719
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,673
Let it dry, dry, dry.

720
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,508
You use ammonia to get the paste.
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

721
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:18,139
And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

722
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,542
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

723
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,751
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

724
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,475
Here is the prize.
Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.
Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

725
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,977
It's like the kitchen in your house.
Says who?
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

726
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,065
Like baking a cake.
Gustavo, too.
- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.
You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

727
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.
simply so they will love you.

728
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,014
- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.
Wha... What the fuck is this?

729
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,767
We... are bandits.
This is me giving you homework.

730
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,365
Look, an old press, an antique.
At Las Margaritas.
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

731
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,853
- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.

732
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,185
And I need you to find out who it is.

733
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,147
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

734
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,956
Now we put it in the oven.
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

735
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,108
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

736
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

737
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,362
Señor Escobar?

738
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,836
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

739
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,615
First day at the American Embassy.
Come meet your daughter.
What's he up to these days?

740
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,089
Well...
- I met my partner...
- Javier?
Barry Seal.

741
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:55,635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.
...who introduced me to the DEA.

742
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,330
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

743
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,930
- No.
- You said a kilo.
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.
Barry Seal, a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football,

744
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,432
We'll take five.
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

745
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:04,436
How do we get five across the border?
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

746
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,797
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.
How beautiful.

747
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,797
which made him perfect CIA material.

748
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,396
That's Gustavo's department.

749
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,342
We are going to Medellín?
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

750
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,261
Shh.

751
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,554
- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

752
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,888
Shh.
Finding Barry was easy.

753
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,112
This one has got a good engine.
Murphy, this is Mil Group.
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

754
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,823
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

755
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,117
would be under the rear wheel well.
Hey, those are classified.
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite, too.

756
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

757
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:22,745
Is this easy to take off?

758
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.
No problem.
No, I'm serious.

759
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:28,001
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.
Look.

760
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:31,045
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.
And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.
Oh, my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

761
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,906
Until next time.

762
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,715
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.
Why do you need this intel?

763
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,244
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

764
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?
Pablo is out of control.
- Goddamn, is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

765
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:42,223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

766
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,248
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

767
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,501
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

768
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,501
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

769
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,518
For three cars, that's 60 kilos.
What does the M-19
have to do with this?
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.
Hi, Vanessa.

770
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.
It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "McPickle"?

771
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,564
$9,000 per kilo.
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.
Oh, no?

772
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,192
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.
And why not?
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

773
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,486
That's it!
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money
Have a seat, Barry.

774
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,404
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

775
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,198
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

776
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:02,160
That's half a million dollars... per trip,
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.
You know what he's doing, right?
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

777
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,312
Yes, Agent Peña?
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

778
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:05,372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.
Well, you guys ain't got shit.

779
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,859
You're bothering me.
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

780
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,959
Easiest money he ever made.
She sure likes you.

781
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,740
Is your informant really a prostitute?
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

782
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,616
Everybody works for somebody.
So what do we do?
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

783
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,218
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

784
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

785
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

786
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:25,099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.
without making a refueling stop.

787
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,460
The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

788
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,935
How are you feeling, Gustavo?
Pablo's home turf.
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

789
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,671
The manifests don't lie.

790
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,523
All this smells like shit to me.
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

791
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

792
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,513
Carlos, what are the guys saying?
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

793
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,571
The stinkier, the better.
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

794
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,350
I imagine that they're worried, right?
Well, damn...
you guys are good.

795
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,489
All right.

796
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,020
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

797
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,325
What about all these lights?
Communist sympathizer.

798
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

799
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,413
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

800
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:50,833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

801
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,193
that's treason and trafficking.

802
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,836
I'm the artist here, clear?
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

803
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,323
You do understand me, brother.

804
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,129
Clear.
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

805
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.
That's right.

806
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:01,719
It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.
Imagine... a state governed by us.

807
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,872
I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.
Well... see,
I figured this day might come.

808
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:05,557
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.
Fresh meat.
Immunity for everyone, brother.

809
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,711
We, Carlos, belong to the people.
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

810
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,101
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

811
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:10,965
Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.
Yeah? What's that?
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

812
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,258
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

813
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,137
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

814
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

815
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,763
I like that.
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

816
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,142
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

817
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,143
There was Carlos Lehder...
Yes.
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas,

818
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,478
He also said that no politician

819
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,869
Let's build them a chimney.
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

820
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,774
...the Ochoa brothers...
for cocaine shipments to the US.

821
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,167
There you go.
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

822
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,571
I couldn't have made that up.

823
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,171
Gentlemen, the first three?
Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

824
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,716
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

825
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,843
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

826
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,180
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

827
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

828
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,962
Is that Gacha?
Well, that's what he said.

829
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,936
I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

830
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,423
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

831
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,176
And if I tell you, Carlos...
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

832
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,985
Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.
And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

833
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:00,723
that what I want, sincerely...

834
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:03,197
Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

835
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,018
Get pictures of that fucker.
is to help the poor people
of this country...

836
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,701
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

837
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,938
do you believe me or what?

838
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,202
Trust me, Pablito.

839
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,246
I love it. Let's do it.
They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants,

840
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,153
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.
but frankly,
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

841
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,252
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.
He was just another busted trafficker

842
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,949
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

843
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

844
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,493
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

845
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,590
It's Gustavo.
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

846
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,800
Five kilos, right?
of the famed Medellín cartel.
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

847
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,429
Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

848
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,123
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

849
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,931
He was a family man till the end.
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

850
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

851
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

852
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,313
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.
Washington is gonna go crazy.

853
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,525
He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

854
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,887
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,
Pablo! Pablo!
Thank you, Ambassador.

855
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

856
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,849
is that we form an organization.
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

857
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

858
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,
Of course.

859
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,990
Here's three.
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

860
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,702
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.
Thank you.

861
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,578
- That's right.
- Pablito...
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,
In Washington, "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

862
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,080
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

863
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:57,071
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

864
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,417
Look, my love...
it won't fit me.
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

865
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,252
Try it on.
"Death to Kidnappers."

866
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,546
Come here.
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

867
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,422
That's it.
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

868
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,923
Good, right?
What I propose:
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

869
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,081
I will manage all operational aspects.
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

870
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,511
One...
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

871
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,624
his front man,
once the election was over.

872
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,889
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

873
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,545
As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

874
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,432
...three.

875
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:15,797
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

876
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.
I say he's running toward his death.

877
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,021
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

878
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,982
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

879
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,653
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

880
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,640
As for us, we were kind of divided.
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

881
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

882
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,407
He looks very handsome, son.
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

883
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,560
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

884
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,825
Like a fag model, isn't that right?
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

885
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,438
Salud.
and Escobar's reach was long.

886
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,830
The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.
Death to Kidnappers!
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

887
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,483
No one will go on record.
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

888
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,111
I got a better idea.
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

889
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,252
Welcome to the United States.
We let him win.

890
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:42,004
Thank you.
Have a great day.
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,
Whoops.

891
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,491
We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

892
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:42,963
Next, please.
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

893
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,842
His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

894
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,912
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

895
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:51,806
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.
right into the heart of the action.
But first, we had to get proof

896
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,250
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

897
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,794
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña, if he wanted a long life,

898
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.
So we went to Suárez,

899
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,838
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.
and gave him a lot of money.
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

900
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,061
Go figure.

901
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:01,065
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

902
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,734
on a fleet of small planes.
Sit down, my love.
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

903
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,736
- What's up?
- What's up, son?
Look on the bright side, man.

904
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

905
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,448
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.
- How are you?
- Good. And you?
From then on, according to Reagan,

906
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,157
Whoo! It's so hot.
I like your hat.
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

907
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?
It looks good on you.

908
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,578
You like my jacket, brother?
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

909
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,790
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

910
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,650
Let's see.

911
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,403
Very cute.
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

912
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,419
I was in jail for a while, remember?
planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

913
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,741
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

914
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

915
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:28,426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

916
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,829
She should be here by now.

917
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.
Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

918
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,331
You think she slipped?
who reported the arrest...

919
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,889
It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.
Nah, she's no dummy.

920
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,169
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

921
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,015
Yes, sir.

922
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:38,381
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

923
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,923
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

924
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:39,895
Here you go.

925
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,216
Yeah.
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

926
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,483
Go on. There are five kilos.
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

927
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,221
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

928
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,318
Where are you going?
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

929
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,987
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

930
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

931
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,937
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

932
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,288
The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

933
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,649
Aah...
Got it!

934
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,666
Drugs in, cash out.
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia,

935
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:03,002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,
Finally, it dawned on us.
Medellín's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

936
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,072
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

937
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,547
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

938
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,992
And that was a problem.
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

939
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:10,217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,
- You're tired.
- Hm?
but in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

940
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

941
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,582
Let me relax you a bit.

942
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

943
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,504
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

944
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.
ten times this if you give me one hour.

945
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?
There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

946
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,817
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

947
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.
And what am I doing here?

948
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,889
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States,

949
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,765
What did you hear?
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

950
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,448
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways
Nothing.
Just making conversation.
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

951
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:34,617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

952
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,328
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?
Your party took money from Escobar.
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

953
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:40,649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

954
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,914
You guys are pilots,
Everyone took money.

955
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:43,237
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

956
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:43,376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.
They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

957
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

958
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:46,198
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

959
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,298
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán,

960
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,909
Then they killed her somewhere else.

961
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,785
She knew the risks.
Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

962
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,343
We'll take four.
If we're going back,
we go back now.

963
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:53,887
All right, much better.
The New Liberal party had the candidate

964
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:58,683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...
Extradition would become his battle cry.

965
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,667
I want you to find the girl.
Gentlemen?

966
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,753
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

967
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

968
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,713
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thank you.

969
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,437
- See you later.
- Later.
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...
And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

970
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,926
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

971
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,148
Come in, please.

972
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,845
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.
I wish to communicate to you my decision

973
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,304
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

974
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,430
That's it, guys.
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

975
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,031
Look, here are the packets.
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

976
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,479
...for reasons of family and health.

977
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.
against the legality of extradition.

978
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:20,774
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

979
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,078
Easy, right?
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

980
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,706
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

981
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:22,874
All right?
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

982
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,042
But with you two,
we have a problem.
Can we buy someone in that court?

983
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,044
You girls are pregnant, right?
- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

984
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,758
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.
Unfortunately, no.

985
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,034
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

986
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,618
I will give my best effort.

987
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:36,679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.
What, did you kill her?
Thank you very much.

988
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,830
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

989
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,891
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.
Brother... even after he's dead,

990
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,435
All right? All right. Perfect.
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

991
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,463
It's my turn now.

992
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,355
During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá
He's totally fucked.

993
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,882
This is gringo bullshit.

994
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,274
had several mules on them.
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

995
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,443
They didn't even know about each other.

996
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,111
And you know what?
We're next, aren't we?

997
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:56,323
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

998
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,182
You're right.

999
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,184
Pablito?

1000
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,367
All we cared about was grass.
Do you have an answer or what?

1001
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:05,959
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.
Where's the girl?

1002
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:08,403
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

1003
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,987
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

1004
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,087
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

1005
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,614
I don't know.

1006
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,451
in a poor city, in a poor country,
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

1007
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,159
Choke him.

1008
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,828
and by the time you were 28 years old,
Carlos was one of us.

1009
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,956
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

1010
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:22,209
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

1011
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,088
Enough with the party.
What do you do?
You make your dreams come true.
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

1012
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,756
So, brothers...

1013
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,148
But even that didn't do it.
I gotta rough this girl up.

1014
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:34,487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

1015
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,181
Gacha's paranoid.
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

1016
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,974
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

1017
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,894
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

1018
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,700
Do you trust this guy?

1019
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

1020
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,065
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

1021
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.
It's all right, boys.

1022
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:48,944
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

1023
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,249
But he's got good routes.
This one's for all of you!
Slap her around!
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

1024
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,739
Two million US dollars.

1025
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,964
- Amigos!
- Hello, Carlos.

1026
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,423
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.
It's very dangerous.

1027
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

1028
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,677
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

1029
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

1030
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,348
Smooth.
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

1031
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,683
Let's get down to business.

1032
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.
Any news on the radio?
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

1033
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,590
- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

1034
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:10,982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

1035
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,634
Sorry, I don't speak English.
But even magical realism has its limits.

1036
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,776
- How far?
- Miami.

1037
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,265
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

1038
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,933
Excuse me.
But for us, brother...

1039
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- 1000 kilos?
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

1040
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,686
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

1041
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,076
Counting the gasoline.
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

1042
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:25,481
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

1043
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,400
We have an historical obligation.

1044
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,109
All right.

1045
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,570
- What is your name?
- Juan.

1046
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,238
Look, Juan...
We can't forget that.

1047
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,003
Carlos...
I'm his girlfriend.

1048
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,005
Yes?
that is a really nice tie.

1049
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,661
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

1050
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,078
Yes.

1051
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,428
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap
Well, she's in the history books now.

1052
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?
Meet Pablo Escobar.

1053
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,418
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

1054
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,142
We'll leave the engine, right?
- Thank you.
- All right.
Miss.

1055
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,088
- OK.
- We have a deal.

1056
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:49,937
How much more?
All right, then.

1057
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,439
About... 300 more.
And when you get too close to the sun...

1058
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,842
We were just leaving.

1059
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,486
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.
your dreams may melt away.
Good night.

1060
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,908
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

1061
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:07,080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.
What the hell is this?

1062
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,106
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

1063
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,901
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

1064
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.
Good morning.

1065
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:15,922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.
In exchange for what?

1066
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:18,325
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

1067
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:17,506
in the middle of the jungle.

1068
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,790
The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

1069
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

1070
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,123
Helena?
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

1071
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:27,641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

1072
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,711
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

1073
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,878
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

1074
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:31,631
I'm going to get you
out of here, OK? I promise.
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

1075
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,882
Thank you very much.

1076
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,940
We brought you a little present.

1077
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,317
Brazilians.
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

1078
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,197
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

1079
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,784
No, I'm not feeling well.
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

1080
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,410
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.
Connie?

1081
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,370
Hey, Gustavo.
All right. She's coming out.
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions
Elisa? What's going on?

1082
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,832
What the fuck is up with you guys?
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

1083
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,585
You're flying around in planes...
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

1084
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,445
Yeah.

1085
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca--
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

1086
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,532
Copy, Major.
About what?

1087
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,715
Look, let us explain what we have to--
Let's go, boys.
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

1088
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,467
Wait.
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

1089
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,845
From now on,
in all of my labs...
To this charge, I plead guilty.
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

1090
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...
No habla inglés, huh?
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

1091
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,836
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

1092
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,293
¡Vamos!
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

1093
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,019
- And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

1094
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,129
and you need to hide me.

1095
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,521
- Just for you.
- One problem.
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

1096
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,048
OK. Come on.

1097
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,525
These are my labs. Mm?

1098
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,386
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

1099
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,720
Over there.
Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

1100
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,602
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

1101
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:28,619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

1102
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

1103
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,898
I just hope he's here.

1104
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,458
Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.
Congressman Escobar...
I am.

1105
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,212
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.
- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

1106
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,657
- How is she?
- Sedated.
I'll be right back. Go.

1107
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,507
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

1108
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,302
How something like this
can make so much money!
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

1109
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,204
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

1110
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:49,556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

1111
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,251
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man--
You are not welcome in this chamber.
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

1112
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,600
What do you think, Pablo?
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

1113
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.
You don't belong here.
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

1114
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,299
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.
Escobar and M-19?

1115
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,813
I wouldn't get involved.
She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

1116
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,150
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.
No... that doesn't make any sense.

1117
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.
She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

1118
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.
OK. All right.

1119
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,951
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,
Is that understood?

1120
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

1121
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,191
Understood.

1122
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

1123
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.
I hope you know what that means.
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

1124
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:25,092
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.
- ...supreme court building.
- Oh, my God.

1125
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,555
You need a lot of creativity for that.
"Oh, my God" is right.

1126
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:30,790
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

1127
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:31,000
Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

1128
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?
He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.
and occupied the supreme court.

1129
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:37,688
You deliver the product to me, labeled.
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

1130
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,051
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

1131
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:41,316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

1132
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,137
Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.
but it was all bullshit.

1133
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,986
Better yet, Lehder will do it.
What interests the narcos

1134
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,
Big mistake.
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,
The military attacked.
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

1135
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,142
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

1136
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

1137
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--
His two arms: silver or lead.
Most of the M-19 were killed.

1138
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

1139
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,497
Deal?

1140
00:37:55,442 --> 00:38:01,573
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

1141
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:02,490
"Deliver Marta Ochoa
safe and sound... or your family is next."

1142
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,919
Deal.
setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

1143
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,213
Sounds good to me.

1144
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:05,452
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

1145
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:07,676
All right,
I will create my own routes
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

1146
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:08,497
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

1147
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

1148
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,266
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.
Please! Please, let me go.

1149
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,629
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.
In the United States,
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

1150
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,726
Partners?
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

1151
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:20,467
Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,
so they can't testify in court.

1152
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,718
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

1153
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:22,608
We know your policy toward partners.
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

1154
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,804
I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

1155
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:25,861
Let's just call us...
before the Colombian people.

1156
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,696
"friendly associates."
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

1157
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,991
To Miami.
And the killing didn't stop.
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.
as cannon shells exploded inside.

1158
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
To Miami!
Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

1159
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:36,233
It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

1160
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,568
Tell him to get a little closer.

1161
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,361
can be threatened or bought at will,

1162
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,321
A little closer. A little closer!
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.
- Where is she?
- Well, come on in.

1163
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,157
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

1164
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:47,841
When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer
But Lara wouldn't back down.

1165
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,283
Put the gun away.

1166
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,328
so you can see the tree!
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,
Put it away.

1167
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,248
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

1168
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,913
That's it.
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

1169
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,668
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams
- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

1170
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:57,086
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

1171
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:57,768
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.
were owned by drug traffickers.
Murphy... calm down.

1172
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,673
That...
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

1173
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,257
That's it. Perfect.

1174
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS
Your wife brought her to me.

1175
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,177
A little more.
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

1176
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,263
That's it! There you go.

1177
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,850
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

1178
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

1179
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,325
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

1180
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

1181
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,066
of elephants and camels from Africa.
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

1182
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,278
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?
Well, she's M-19.

1183
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,696
And with the action of one brave man,
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

1184
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,531
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

1185
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,779
and then she gets disappeared.

1186
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,574
Stupid asshole.
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

1187
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,007
Pablo's coke flooded in.
It's a woman with a baby.
What are required are honest men,

1188
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

1189
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,
Look, all she did was warn us.

1190
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,095
And I mean that.
She's not on anybody's radar.

1191
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:39,797
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

1192
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.
Do it.
Good day, ma'am.
She's not involved in anything.

1193
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,796
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

1194
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,353
And with the money...

1195
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,673
who is against their interests.
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

1196
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:43,314
came the violence.
What do you mean the park is closed?
Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

1197
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,009
May I escort you out?

1198
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

1199
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.
with his stand against the narcos.

1200
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.
He just wouldn't stop going after them.
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

1201
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:55,186
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.
Folks, this is more complicated
than what it seems.

1202
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,102
I thought I smelled something.
This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

1203
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,604
- Right?
- Yes.
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

1204
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,398
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

1205
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,941
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

1206
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,195
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

1207
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,070
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

1208
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:07,240
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

1209
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,074
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

1210
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,617
Oh, very good.
Congratulations!
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

1211
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,579
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.
You feel responsible, is that it?

1212
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,495
You willing to identify this informant,
Agent Peña?

1213
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:17,208
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

1214
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.
Somewhat, yes, sir.
- No, I am not.
- Needless to say...

1215
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:20,253
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

1216
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

1217
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,143
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.
Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

1218
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,382
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk
in light of this communist aggression.

1219
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:26,648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

1220
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,677
for American policy objectives?
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

1221
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company
If he could do this
to the feared communists,

1222
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,137
he could do it to anyone.
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

1223
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,653
to hold all the extra corpses.

1224
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,308
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...
you... did nothing.

1225
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,699
That was the first person I ever shot.
there was only one thing he could do.

1226
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:37,604
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

1227
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

1228
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,607
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

1229
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,314
Hey, Don Pablo.

1230
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,984
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

1231
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,155
Should I kill him or what?

1232
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,491
They're looking for us everywhere.

1233
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,707
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

1234
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,535
What did you expect?

1235
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,579
That it would be any different?

1236
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,250
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

1237
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,975
Hey... it was self-defense.
You did a very good job.

1238
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,212
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...
And what is that?

1239
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

1240
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,300
but with the sword of Bolívar.

1241
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

1242
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,776
He sells drugs, right?

1243
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

1244
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,728
Just wear the vest.
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

1245
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,648
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

1246
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,371
What happened?

1247
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,210
- Coming through!
- I was about to finish my shift
You, Ivan...

1248
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

1249
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:31,964
Stay with me.
Oh, Pablito.

1250
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

1251
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.
The same one that freed this country.

1252
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,265
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.
Damned bastards.

1253
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:45,102
- Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.
Stand up.
Now it belongs to you.

1254
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,646
I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...

1255
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.
You're too good for them, Pablito.
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

1256
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,654
We did everything we could.

1257
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,365
She died in the ER.
From now on,
we are going to work together.
I promise you,
I will continue the fight.

1258
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,536
We tried to save the baby...
You earned it, brother.

1259
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,398
As for me...

1260
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,735
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

1261
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,085
The baby died in my hands.

1262
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,363
Go in peace, brother.
We are also...

1263
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,340
I'm so sorry.
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

1264
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

1265
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:21,041
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

1266
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,720
Two of the pellets split open.
And the fucking sword.

1267
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,268
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

1268
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,088
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

1269
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,714
Is that what I think it is?

1270
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,272
No one survives that.
You've gotta be kidding.

1271
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,178
I will fix it.

1272
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,600
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

1273
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,325
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

1274
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.
And you'll do what?

1275
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,401
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

1276
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,373
Tell me something, Cockroach.

1277
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,568
Liberate Colombia.

1278
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

1279
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,780
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

1280
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,670
Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

1281
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:55,492
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

1282
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:58,717
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

1283
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:58,994
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

1284
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:01,165
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

1285
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

1286
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,056
Never say that to Pablo.
a voice for those who had no voice,

1287
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,142
He's not as forgiving as I am.
but that has happened
through much of our history.

1288
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,925
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

1289
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:15,234
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.
I dreamt of doing good.

1290
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.
The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.
Those dreams are over.

1291
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,616
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

1292
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,685
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

1293
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,772
were so invested
in the future of their country

1294
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,038
Stop!
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.
I will fight.

1295
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,610
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

1296
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:35,740
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

1297
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:39,535
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

1298
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:40,509
What do you have in the spare tires?

1299
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,957
Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

1300
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:46,681
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

1301
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,335
Thank you very much.

1302
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:51,019
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?
She wanted to make a difference.

1303
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,339
Thank you very much.

1304
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,979
Just what I said, we lost it.
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

1305
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:56,176
Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

1306
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:59,194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

1307
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,763
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

1308
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:02,322
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

1309
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

1310
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,394
Hey, stop right here.

1311
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,120
Look...

1312
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:14,418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

1313
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,071
Praise God.

1314
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,531
He didn't wear it.

1315
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,422
So how did we lose a load, brother?

1316
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:21,883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.
Wouldn't have made a difference.

1317
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,469
Know what I mean?
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

1318
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,624
Perdón.

1319
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,920
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

1320
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:30,809
And how much is he asking?
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

1321
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:33,395
Too much.

1322
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,884
Hey, did we leave the door open?
- As for Suárez...
- Hey.

1323
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,179
...he made so much money
playing both sides,

1324
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,944
What are you going to do?
Oh, my God, Steve!
he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.

1325
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,656
Come back, Pablo.
Get back.

1326
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,076
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

1327
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,022
I brought this for your friend's wife.

1328
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,828
Where are you going, Pablo?

1329
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:51,788
Pablo?
- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

1330
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,319
You stay right there
and don't move.
You're fucking crazy, asshole.

1331
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:05,026

1333
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,923
What's going on, brother?

1334
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,260
Mr. Escobar...

1335
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,640
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

1336
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,272
Eat. Shit.

1337
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,860
What if I shot you in the head?

1338
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,961
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

1339
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:27,426
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

1340
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,846
We're DAS, Ibarra.

1341
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,890
What's that faggot gonna do?

1342
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:38,895
There we are.

1343
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,773
No, lower, lower.

1344
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,190
No that low.

1345
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,361
Ready.

1346
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:52,826
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

1347
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,499
Pablo didn't know it then...

1348
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,336
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

1349
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:09,301
Remove the handcuffs.

1350
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:16,141
You can go now, officer.

1351
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,144
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

1352
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

1353
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:35,201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

1354
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,371
And you only gave us $150,000.

1355
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:42,501
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

1356
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,545
You know something?

1357
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,674
I make deals for a living.

1358
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:53,804
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

1359
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,686
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

1360
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:03,313
and everyone goes home happy.

1361
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:06,983
Deal?

1362
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,536
I'll give you one million dollars...

1363
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:21,122
under one condition.

1364
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,042
What is it?

1365
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:30,006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

1366
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,385
Otherwise, how would you know?

1367
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:39,307
Give me a name...

1368
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

1369
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,820
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

1370
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:55,073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

1371
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

1372
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:06,125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

1373
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

1374
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:14,843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

1375
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:19,723
The plan was to trade vehicles,

1376
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

1377
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,105
1200 kilos.

1378
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:30,024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

1379
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,612
OK, gringos.

1380
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,697
How's the plumbing business?

1381
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:37,115
Fine.

1382
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,580
- How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

1383
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,500
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

1384
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:50,629
Everything was going perfect.

1385
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:55,717
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

1386
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,719
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

1387
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,472
Got a full load here, Murph--

1388
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,690
Don't move! Don't move.

1389
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,902
Don't move! Don't move.

1390
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,278
Get down!

1391
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:21,034
Hands! Down!

1392
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,201
Don't look at me.

1393
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:26,915
Fucking...

1394
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:51,064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

1395
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:54,275
after taking into account
all due considerations,

1396
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,572
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

1397
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,243
I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

1398
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

1399
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

1400
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:17,883
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

1401
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

1402
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:31,563
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

1403
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

1404
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:37,360
no one much cared about that.

1405
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

1406
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:46,536
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

1407
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,623
And that... America couldn't take.

1408
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:56,462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

1409
00:51:56,671 --> 00:52:00,717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

1410
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:06,098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

1411
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,601
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

1412
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

1413
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:15,982
It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

1414
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,235
Drugs are menacing our society.

1415
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

1416
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:25,033
They're killing our children.

1417
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,910
It was classic Reagan.

1418
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:29,913
Folksy, direct and tough.

1419
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:33,249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

1420
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

1421
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,965
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

1422
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,175
But not when you can't see it.

1423
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:47,472
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

1424
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,849
as a precious gift to His children.

1425
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,935
Say yes to your life.

1426
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:56,314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

1427
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,858
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

1428
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,026
No, no!

1429
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:08,034
They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

1430
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,120
only the cockroaches will survive.

1431
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,330
Leave that piece of shit there.

1432
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,290
I guess they were wrong.

1433
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,337
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

1434
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

1435
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

1436
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

1437
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,604
No way.

1438
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:41,818
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

1439
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

1440
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,158
It was his duty.

1441
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,953
Cocaine in Miami?

1442
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,955
Kilos from Colombia?

1443
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,333
This was my war.

1444
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,919
This was my duty.

1445
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,796
And I was ready to fight it.

1446
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

1447
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,758
Your ticket, please.

1448
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,302
OK.

1449
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:11,389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

1450
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:17,062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

1451
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:18,813
OK, man, what do we got?

1452
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:22,025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

1453
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:23,442
We got Lizard.

1454
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,320
Uh...

1455
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,822
We got, we got...

1456
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

1457
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,289
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

1458
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,975
If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

1459
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

1460
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:03,775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

1461
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,947
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

1462
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,908
and hope for the best.

1463
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,620
Look at what happened, boss.

1464
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

1465
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

1466
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:27,132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

1467
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

1468
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:39,769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

1469
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,313
Half a million?

1470
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:42,605
Do it.

1471
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,190
As you wish, sir.

1472
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,447
Fucking gringos.

1473
00:55:56,696 --> 00:56:01,696
